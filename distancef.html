    <h2>Getting distance feature for your dataset</h2>

    <p>
     The importance of location information is not limited to real estate 
     dataset only; it could add value to the various domains in Machine 
     Learning such as transportation, e-commerce, geology, 
     agriculture and many more. To get the information of a 
     location such as how far from the city center is 
     straightforward if information is required for a single city. 
      We simply could calculate the distance using latitude and longitude 
      of two data points.  For example, we have location information of two 
      points, Millennium Park Chicago (Latitude: 41.882702, Longitude: 
      -87.619392) and Des Moines International Airport, 
      Iowa (Latitude: 41.5347119, Longitude: -93.6604968). 
      The correct calculation of distance between two points 
      in earth surface is using Haversine formula which calculates
       the distance between two points on a sphere 
       (ref: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula"> Wikipedia/Haversine_formula</a>).

     This technique could be implemented to calculate distance from any 
     reference location. However, to calculate location information of 
     larger area for example whole state or country is little tricky 
     because there could be multiple big cities as reference points. 
     In this article, I am presenting one technique of getting location 
     information for a large region using zip code. It is certain that
    latitude and longitude coordinates of two points of interest could
    be more precise to get the accurate distance however it is not 
    convenient to get location information for a large region.
     For example, we have location information of two points, Empire State 
     Building, New York city (Zip code: 10001) and Willis Tower Chicago
     (Zip code: 60606). The distance between these two zip codes 
     can be calculated using pgeocode library as shown in the following example:
    </p>
    <img class="article-img" src="images/pegocode_dist.jpg" alt= 'calculate distance'/>
       
    <p> Following zip codes from list of top 500 big cities in the 
         US was implemented to calculate the distance of a given zip 
         code from any of these cities. 
    </p>
     <img class="article-img" src="images/df500zips.jpg" />
    <p>
    zip500_list = list(zip_cities['zip_code']) # list of all 500 big city zipcodes 
    There should be zip code in the dataset then the distance for a 
    data point to the nearest big city in the above list is calculated in miles. 
    We are going to calculate the distance from nearest city among 500 big 
    cities in US for the following zip codes in the dataframe:

      <img class="article-img" src="images/algo_code.jpg" />
      <img class="article-img" src="images/final_df.jpg" />
    <p>
    Finally, this distance of the location of interest from the big 
    could be an important feature and adds value to the dataset.
