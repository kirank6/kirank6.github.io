     The importance of location information is not limited to real estate 
     dataset only; it could add value to the various domains in Machine 
     Learning such as transportation, e-commerce, geology, 
     agriculture and many more. To get the information of a 
     location such as how far from the city center is 
     straightforward if information is required for a single city. 
      We simply could calculate the distance using latitude and longitude 
      of two data points.  For example, we have location information of two 
      points, Millennium Park Chicago (Latitude: 41.882702, Longitude: 
      -87.619392) and Des Moines International Airport, 
      Iowa (Latitude: 41.5347119, Longitude: -93.6604968). 
      The correct calculation of distance between two points 
      in earth surface is using Haversine formula which calculates
       the distance between two points on a sphere 
       (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).
